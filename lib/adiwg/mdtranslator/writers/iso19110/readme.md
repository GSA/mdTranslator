### Writer for ISO 19110 Feature Catalogue

The mdTranslator 'iso19110' writer implements about 70% of the for ISO 19110 standard. Efforts were made to include all elements of the ISO standard that describe entity-attribute descriptions for tabular data, spreadsheets, and relational databases.

The ISO 19110 record can be used to provide data dictionary information for ISO 19115-2 metadata (circa 2003) and is delivered as a separate file from the ISO 19115-2 resource metadata.  This inconvenient implementation was improved in the 2014 revision ISO 19115-1 schema.  mdTranslator will provide support for ISO 19115-1 sometime in 2017.
