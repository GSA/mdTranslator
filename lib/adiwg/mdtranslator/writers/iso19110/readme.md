### Writer for ISO 19110 Feature Catalogue

The mdTranslator iso19110 writer implements about 65% of the for ISO 19110 standard.
Efforts were made to include all elements of the ISO standard that support general entity
attribute definitions to adequately describe tabular data, spreadsheets, and relational
databases.

The Feature Catalogue section provides data dictionary information for ISO 19115-2 metadata
and is saved as separate file from the ISO 19115-2 metadata.  This inconvenient implementation was
corrected in the ISO 19115-1:2014 revision and will be supported by the iso19115_1 writer.
