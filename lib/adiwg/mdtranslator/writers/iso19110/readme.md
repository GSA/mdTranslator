### Writer for ISO 19110 Feature Catalogue

The mdTranslator iso19110 writer implements about 60% of the for ISO 19110 standard.
Efforts were made to include all elements of the ISO standard to describe entity
attribute definitions for tabular data, spreadsheets, and relational databases.

The Feature Catalogue section provides data dictionary information for ISO 19115-2 metadata
and is delivered as a separate file from the ISO 19115-2 metadata.  This inconvenient implementation
was corrected in the 2014 revision ISO 19115-1.  mdTranslator will provide support for ISO 19115-1
sometime in 2015.
