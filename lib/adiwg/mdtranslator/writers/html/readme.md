### Writer for HTML 'human-readable' output of metadata

The HTML version of metadata is intended to be a human readable
version of the metadata content.  The HTML output does not mimic
any established metadata standard but remains agnostic in its
presentation.  The HTML metadata version will present the entire
content of the metadata provided to the mdTranslator reader.

The HTML writer can be use to allow users to conveniently scan
metadata prior to downloading a data file or to generate a printed
version of metadata to accompany a report.
