### Writer for HTML 'human-readable' version of metadata

The HTML version of metadata is intended to be a human readable
version of the metadata content.  The HTML output does not mimic
any established metadata standard but remains agnostic in its
presentation.  The HTML metadata version will present the entire
content of the metadata record delivered to the reader.
