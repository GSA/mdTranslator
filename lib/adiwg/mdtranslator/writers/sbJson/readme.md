### Writer for ScienceBase JSON metadata format (sbJSON)

The ScienceBase Item core is based on the Dublin Core Metadata 
Element Set but also includes other elements that may or may not 
be associated with other metadata standards that are useful for 
the core attribution of ScienceBase items. It is used as a means 
to integrate across multiple metadata standards, conventions, and 
practices in describing a wide array of scientific data and 
information assets important to science teams using ScienceBase.

The sbJSON format is fully documented on 
the [ScienceBase Confluence page](https://my.usgs.gov/confluence/display/sciencebase/ScienceBase+Information+Model).

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) ScienceBase Catalog contains 
metadata about digital and non-digital scientific data assets. 
The ScienceBase Catalog provides the central information about 
everything in ScienceBase using a flexible information model 
based on the simple metadata elements of the Dublin Core Metadata 
Element Set.
