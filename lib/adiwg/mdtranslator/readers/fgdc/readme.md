### Reader for Federal Geographic Data Committee's Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (fgdc)

Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM), Vers. 2 
(FGDC-STD-001-1998) is the current version of this FGDC authored and 
endorsed standard. Executive Order 12906, directed that Federal agencies 
document geospatial resources using this standard. Since the publication 
of EO 12906, the FGDC has endorsed several ISO Geospatial Metadata 
Standards that are now encouraged for use.

The FGDC CSDGM format standard is fully documented on the 
[Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata page](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/csdgm-standard).
