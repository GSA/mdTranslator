### Reader for ADIwg JSON metadata format (mdJson)

The mdJson format is a simple JSON format for documenting and 
exchanging information about scientific projects and data.  
The Alaska Data Integration working group (ADIwg) wrote the standard 
to support translation to complex standards such as the ISO 19115-2 
Geographic Metadata standard and FGDC's Content Standard for Digital 
Geospatial Metadata.  The mdJson standard remains independent of any 
published standards while comprehensive enough to support translation 
to established standards. The mdJson record is also a convenient format 
to exchange directly with other organizations as the JSON structure 
is easily created and ingest by programming languages.

The mdJson format is fully documented on the interactive
[mdTools](http://mdTools.adiwg.org) website.
