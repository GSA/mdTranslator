### Reader for ADIwg JSON metadata format (mdJson)

The adiwgJson format is a simple JSON format for documenting and exchanging information
about scientific projects and data.  The Alaska Data Integration working group (ADIwg) wrote the
standard to support translation to complex standards such as the ISO 19115-2 Geographic Metadata standard
and FGDC's Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata.  The adiwgJson standard
remains independent of any published standards while comprehensive enough to support translation
to many. The adiwgJson standard is also a convenient format to exchange directly with other organizations as
the JSON structure is easier read and ingest by many programming languages.

The adiwg format is fully documented on the interactive
[adiwgJson Viewer](http://jlblcc.github.io/json-schema-viewer/) website.
