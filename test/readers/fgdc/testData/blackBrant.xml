      <abstract>This data contains two tables of live-dead encounter histories of Black Brant geese banded 4 breeding locations in the Arctic of northern Alaska and western Canada and one sub-Arctic location, the Tutakoke River colony on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of Alaska, from 1990 to 2016.  </abstract>
      <purpose>We used joint live and dead mark recapture models to estimate first-year and adult (1+ year old) survival of brant, which have not been assessed since the 1990s for Arctic populations and mid-2000s for sub-Arctic breeding populations.  We also used band recovery rates from a Brownie model to assess temporal trends in harvest rates of adult brant.  </purpose>
      <supplinf>This data set contains two banding and encounter history tables: one for the joint live dead analysis and one for the Brownie analysis. These data files are formatted in a machine-readable format for use with program MARK and RMark applications. The specific formatting is described in the entity attribute section.</supplinf>

      <descgeog>Banding data was collected on four Black Brant breeding locations in the Arctic: 1) the Colville River Delta in northern Alaska, 2) the Kuparuk River Delta/Prudhoe Bay in northern Alaska, 3) the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula/Liverpool Bay area in northern Canada, and 4) Banks Island and Victoria Island, Northwest Territories, Canada.  One sub-Arctic location, the Tutakoke River colony on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of western Alaska was also used.  Band encounters came resightings of banded birds on the breeding grounds and also from banding resightings and recovery of bands by sport hunters throughout North America during the non-breeding period.

    <tool>
      <tooldesc>Program MARK is a Windows-based software application, developed by Gary White (Colorado State University) for the analysis of data from marked individuals. Program MARK provides parameter estimates from marked animals when they are re-encountered at a later time. Re-encounters can be from dead recoveries (e.g., the animal is harvested), live recaptures (e.g. the animal is re-trapped or re-sighted), radio tracking, or from some combination of these sources of re-encounters.</tooldesc>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Attributes were spot checked and values were sorted to identify possible errors.  For example, if data looked like a potential error, original data sheets were checked to confirm and fixed it if it was a data entry error. Additionally peer-review used sort functions in Excel to identify attributes, domains, and domain ranges.  These were checked against metadata entries to ensure all definitions and levels were accounted for.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>Data format and values are specific for use with program MARK and have been tested in that application, thus data values are considered valid for that usage.</logic>
    <complete>There are no missing values in this dataset.  Users are advised to read the rest of the metadata record carefully for additional details, particularly the Entity and Attribute definitions for specifics on each entity and data within those entities.</complete>

      <method>
        <methtype>Field</methtype>
        <methdesc>We captured brant by herding them into pens during the adult remigial molt in July and August.  Following capture, we marked brant with a unique metal band issued by the Bird Banding Lab, U.S. Geological Survey, and a uniquely engraved plastic tarsal band, and recorded bands from recaptures.  Brant were sexed using cloacal examination and aged as juvenile (hatching year), second-year, or after second-year using plumage characteristics.  Prior to banding, we recorded live resights of color-marked brant on breeding areas using 20–50x spotting scopes.  We included all summer reencounters in our analysis (not just breeding reencounters, for example, adults seen at a nest or with a brood) to improve the precision of our survival estimates.</methdesc>
      </method>
      <method>
        <methtype>Field</methtype>
        <methdesc>We conducted live resight surveys at 3 wintering lagoons along the central Pacific coast of Baja California.  Observations were made at Bahia San Quintin during winters 1991-1993, 1997–2006, and 2011–2013 and at Lagunas Ojo de Liebre and San Ignacio, during winters 1999-2001.  From spring 1991–2015 we conducted resights of brant at wintering and migration areas in southeastern Vancouver Island and Boundary Bay, British Columbia, Canada.  We also periodically collected live resights of brant during migration and wintering at Izembek Lagoon, AK; Humboldt and Morro bays, California; and Puget Sound, WA.  Observers typically concealed themselves near sand bars where brant came ashore to grit and loaf during high tide and read tarsal bands with 15–150X telescopes.  
	We obtained band recovery information of brant harvested (i.e., “How obtained” code = 01) from August 1990–May 2016 from the U.S. Geological Survey Bird Banding Laboratory in Patuxent, Maryland, USA.  Our ‘recovery window’ for each year was 1 August to 30 June.  We only included brant that were color-marked in our analysis to avoid strong heterogeneity in live reencounter rates with individuals that were only marked with a metal band.</methdesc>

        <procdesc>Data on bandings and encounters were converted into capture histories, where 1's indicate the banding and subsequent encounter(s) of that same band in a given year and zeros represent no encounter in a given year.  We sorted individuals into 2 groups, those marked at sub-Arctic and those marked in Arctic locations.  We included 2 age classes in our analysis: juveniles (&lt; 1 year old), and adult (1+ years old) brant and allowed juveniles to ‘graduate’ to adults after their second summer.  Though most individual capture histories began with initial banding during summer, we included 2,975 brant marked at Tutakoke River before 1990 whose capture histories began with their first live summer reencounter during or after 1990.</procdesc>

        <enttypd>Brownie dead recovery model (Brownie et al. 1985) implemented with RMark (Laake 2013) to estimate band recovery rates. The data files have a single column heading on the first row, but these do not align with the columns they are describing because this format is meant to serve as an input statement for the common tool for analyzing these kinds of tables.  A fully delimited table would result in a non-machine readable format for this kind of file. LD code is contained within columns 1 through 52, sex in columns 54 to 55, bandage in columns 57 to 58, and location in columns 60 to 61.</enttypd>
