      <abstract>This data set provides a photogrammetry-based digital elevation model (DEM) that covers ~90% of the surface trace of the Eastern Denali Fault between the Alaska-Yukon international border and the village of Haines Junction, Yukon, Canada. The DEM has an average resolution of 4 m/pixel.</abstract>
      <purpose>The eastern section of the Denali Fault did not rupture during the 2002 Denali Fault earthquake (Mw 7.9), however seismologic, geodetic, and geomorphic evidence along with a paleoseismic record of several past ground-rupturing earthquakes demonstrate the fault is active. Thick vegetation, along with complex glacial landforms, large braided rivers, and fault-parallel bedrock structure (e.g., bedding) obscure the Eastern Denali Fault’s surface expression. Plafker and Clague mapped the fault in Alaska and Yukon respectively, providing the basis for generalized digital maps of the structure. While the generalized fault trace maps provide basic information for seismic hazard models (i.e., approximate fault location, total length), detailed fault trace maps may reveal information about past rupture length and offset, complementing paleoseismic information and informing future field investigations. The 13 photogrammetry-based DEMs in this data set cover the ~90% of the active Eastern Denali Fault at a resolution of 3-5 m/pixel. The DEMs facilitate mapping of the co-located Eastern Denali Fault surface trace at a scale of 1:10,000. The DEMs complement other data sets and may inform future investigations by providing an openly accessible digital topography dataset and forms one of several datasets on which we base our mapped interpretation of the location, length, and continuity of the fault’s surface trace. The derivative digitized fault trace may provide geometric constraints useful for modeling earthquake scenarios and related seismic hazard.</purpose>
      <supplinf>We provide a supplemental text file (edf_airphoto_tbl.csv) that documents the file name, year of acquisition, and digital source for each legacy air photo used as source material for the photogrammetric DEM.</supplinf>

      <attraccr>Attributes of the air photo-based DEMs are elevations (in meters) with a roughly 30 m horizontal and relatively uncontrolled vertical registration accuracy. ). Visual inspection and comparison of the airphoto-based DEMs with both the Yukon 30 m DEM and source air photo orthomosaics indicates that the air photo-based rasters are generally registered within ~30 m horizontal accuracy, similar to the accuracy associated with the coarsest Landsat imagery utilized for reference points. Locations where the airphoto-based DEMs appear horizontally misfit in excess of 30 m may be explained by the reported total reference point location errors that approach 80 m, or by internal inconsistencies between compared datasets.We were unable to repair vertical discrepancies of 10s of m between the individual air photo-based DEMs by registering them to other Yukon DEMs, possibly because of differences in DEM resolution. Because we lack both ground survey control and higher resolution DEMs for co-registration, and because our interpretation of fault feature location does not rely on accurate absolute elevations, we accept the vertical discrepancies and inherent limitations these place on the utility of the dataset. We consider the elevation data housed in the air photo-based DEMs suitable for interpretational purposes, but not for quantitative analytical purposes.</attraccr>

    <logic>No formal logical accuracy tests were conducted, but visual inspection and comparison of the airphoto-based DEMs with both the Yukon 30 m DEM and source air photo orthomosaics and Landsat and DigitalGlobe imagery (in Google Earth) indicates that the air photo-based rasters are registered with ~30 m horizontal accuracy. We suggest that the DEMs are useful for qualitative purposes at a minimum 1:10,000 scale.</logic>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>PHOTOGRAMMETRY -- We used Agisoft PhotoScan photogrammetry software (version 1.2.3) to generate dense point clouds from legacy air photos of the fault trace between the Alaska-Yukon border and Haines Junction, Yukon, and constructed DEMs from the point clouds using Quick Terrain Modeler software. Computer hardware system requirements to run ArcMap, PhotoScan, and Quick Terrain Modeler software are similar. We used a Dell Precision Tower optimized to run PhotoScan with a Dual Intel Xeon processor, AMD FirePro 8GB video card, 500 GB Serial-ATA hard drive, and 16 GB memory. To generate the air photo-based DEMs, we generally followed the PhotoScan tutorial workflow (available by searching www.agisoft.com), however we modified the workflow with the following specific steps. We acquired TIF format scans (300 dpi minimum) of legacy air photos from the US Geological Survey Earth Explorer web portal (earthexplorer.usgs.gov) and from Geomatics Yukon (geomaticsyukon.ca). We tended to process no more than two flight lines (up to 12 photos) at a time in PhotoScan. Prior to aligning the photos in PhotoScan, we used the “smart scissors” tool to mask out fiduciary stamps and borders on the photos, and constrained the alignment by the masked photos. Because PhotoScan relies on pixel similarity to align photos, masking prevents misalignment of the photos based on the recurring frame location and, unlike cropping the imported photos outside of PhotoScan, masking does not remove useful data from the source photo set. Before optimizing the calibration of the reconstructed camera positions, we georeferenced each set of aligned photos. To georeference each photoset, we identified 10-12 matching features visible in both Google Earth and in at least two photos (e.g., very small closed lakes, intersecting roads, prominent bedrock features). We used PhotoScan to create reference points on the features in the air photos, and applied the Google Earth coordinates and altitude of each feature to the corresponding reference point. We also assigned a nominal 30 m uncertainty to reflect the reference point location accuracy that we estimated visually. We exported the georeferenced dense point clouds from PhotoScan as LAS files, and used the adaptive triangulation gridding algorithm in Quick Terrain Modeler to construct 3-5 m/pixel resolution DEMs from the point clouds. Although PhotoScan is independently capable of generating DEMs from the point clouds, we used Quick Terrain Modeler because it provides a range of options for gridding, and allows the user to progressively repair holes between points, which we did over distances up to 12 m. We also used Agisoft PhotoScan to generate registered orthomosaics of the air photos. Visual inspection and comparison of the airphoto-based DEMs with both the Yukon 30 m DEM and source air photo orthomosaics indicates that the air photo-based rasters are registered within 30 m horizontal accuracy, similar to the uncertainty associated with the Landsat imagery in Google Earth used to extract reference points.</procdesc>
